  <h1>Terrorism in India: Causes, Impact, and the Path Ahead</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Terrorism has been a significant challenge to national security and social harmony in India for several decades. With its diverse culture, vast geography, and complex socio-political fabric, India has often been the target of various terror groups, both domestic and international. From religious extremism to separatist movements, terrorism in India has taken many forms, threatening the peace, stability, and progress of the nation. This blog aims to explore the root causes, major incidents, impacts, and the way forward in dealing with terrorism in India.</p>

  <h2>Historical Context</h2>
  <p>The roots of terrorism in India can be traced back to pre-independence times, though the modern form of organized terrorism started emerging in the 1980s. The insurgency in Punjab, the rise of separatist movements in Jammu and Kashmir, and the Naxalite-Maoist insurgency in central India have been some of the major sources of internal terror.</p>

  <p>In the 1990s and 2000s, terrorism became more widespread with cross-border terrorism from Pakistan-based groups, particularly after the armed insurgency began in Kashmir in 1989. The infamous Kargil conflict of 1999 and the 2001 Indian Parliament attack are notable examples of terror supported by foreign agencies.</p>
